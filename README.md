# Building deep time series analysis (LSTM) to forecast Stock Prices


# About

The aim of this Project is to use Recurrent Neural Network (such as LSTM and GRU) to predict a stock value based on the movement of several stocks in a portfolio, e.g. HPQ, GOOGL, MSFT, IBM, INTC, ADBE, AMZN and AAPL, the last one we will be trying to predict. 

**Task 1**: Data Exploration and Preparation 
* Explore and visualize characteristics of the provided data. 
* prepare data for deep time series analysis and forecasting.

**Task 2:** Image Denoising  
* Experiment with the provided partial deep forecasting models.
* Select the bestand improve its performance.
* Report all your experimental work.
